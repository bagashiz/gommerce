# Gommerce

## **⚠️WIP⚠️**

## Description

RESTful API for a simple e-commerce web service written in Go programming language. This is a final project for [Project-Based Internship at Evermos](https://www.rakamin.com/virtual-internship-experience/back-end-developer-evermos).

It uses [Fiber](https://gofiber.io) as the web framework, [GORM](https://gorm.io) as the ORM library, and [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com) as the database.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) 1.21.3 or higher and [Task](https://taskfile.dev/installation/) installed on your machine:

   ```bash
   go version && task --version
   ```

2. Install all required tools for the project:

   ```bash
   task install
   ```

3. Create a copy of the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Update configuration values as needed.
